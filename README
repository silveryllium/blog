This is a repository of all the content on my blog and other related things.

From my blog:
Hey! I'm a programmer with a peculiar interest in science and math, or possibly vice versa. 

I currently live on the West Coast and do consulting and freelance programming, and occasionally learn new things and write about them for fun. 

(Speaking of consulting, if you have interesting problems and no one to solve them, drop me a line!)
